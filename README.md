# GitHub-using-Jenkins-Pipeline
## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of Jenkins with a GitHub repository to automate the build and test processes using a Jenkinsfile.

## Tools Needed
1- **AWS EC2:** Virtual server hosting platform for deploying Jenkins and running CI/CD pipelines.

2- **Jenkins:** Continuous Integration (CI) server for automating the build and test processes.

3- **GitHub account:** Version control repository hosting platform for storing your codebase.

4- **Git installed on the Jenkins server:** Version control system required for Jenkins to pull code from the GitHub repository.

5- **Git Flow:** A branching model for Git that helps manage large projects with multiple features and releases.

# Setup Instructions

## GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Create a new GitHub repository:**
    - Log in to your GitHub account.
    - Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
    - Choose a name for your repository, add a description, and select "Initialize this repository with a README".
    - Click "Create repository".

2. **Ensure the repository contains at least two branches:**
    - GitHub typically initializes with the main branch.
    - Create a develop branch using the following commands:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b develop
    git push origin develop
    ```

### Install Git Flow tools on your local machine:

```bash
git clone -b feature/https-remote https://github.com/jgonggrijp/gitflow.git
curl -OL https://raw.github.com/jgonggrijp/gitflow/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh
chmod +x gitflow-installer.sh
sudo ./gitflow-installer.sh
```
### Initialize Git Flow in your repository with default branch names:

```bash
git flow init
```

### Add a Jenkinsfile to your repository:

1. Create a file named Jenkinsfile in the root directory of your repository.

2. Use the following template for a basic pipeline:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                // Add build steps here
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                // Add test steps here
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                // Add deployment steps here
            }
        }
    }
}
